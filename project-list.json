        "designprocess": "I was the project lead and level designer for Splat. I pitched the theme, laid out the initial design, and saw the project through from early sketch to final art pass. Working with environment artist Cooper Furtak, we were able to bring Splat to life as a vibrant, believable paintball field packed with personality and energy. The core gameplay hook revolves around fast-paced, close-quarters combat where decision-making and positioning matter just as much as firepower. Designed specifically for Wingman, Splat features a compact layout that forces early engagements but layers in strategic complexity through multiple attack routes and dynamic defensive choices. The central bombsite is surrounded by inflatable bunkers, wooden palettes, and key landmarks like a parked bus and a wooden “castle” that acts as a sniper perch. Ts can directly attack the site from 2 main options — which include a risky push through or around the bus or a flank via the elevated blue building — while CTs must make real-time decisions on how to allocate their defense between site and a crucial off-site control area that I refer to as the “power zone.” This area offers an alternate route to site and forces both teams to constantly reassess their positioning, encouraging mind games and adaptive strategies. The map's tight geometry also levels the playing field on eco rounds, giving players with shotguns or smart angles a real chance to shine against stronger buys. Visually, I wanted the map to reflect the lively, scrappy nature of paintball arenas I’ve played in — colorful, cluttered, and a little chaotic. The setting — a colorful makeshift battlefield in the Kentucky farmlands — gave us the creative freedom to include classic paintball features like inflatable bunkers, plywood walls, and referee towers, all soaked in bright splashes of color. I worked closely with Cooper to ensure the art direction aligned with the gameplay: every visual element serves a purpose, from the way paint splatters subtly guide the eye to areas of engagement, to the use of distinct landmark structures for callouts and orientation. We developed a mood board to stay aligned on tone and aesthetics, ensuring the final space felt authentic, playful, and competitive. My goal with Splat was to create something punchy, readable, and undeniably fun. Through focused playtesting with both casual players and fellow game designers, I was able to tune the layout until sessions became so engaging that testers wanted to keep playing even after the tests had ended. That was the moment I knew Splat was ready — and I’m incredibly proud of how it turned out."

        "designprocess": "My approach to Debris was quite different from previous projects, as it was the first map I worked on where I wasn't the project lead and had to operate within preset guidelines. I was responsible for designing the layout, blocking it out in-engine for playtesting and refinement, and preparing it for the artists. Gameplay begins with the Ts moving down a large forking path—one leading to long-range engagements, the other to close-quarters combat. The long route pushes players into an open no man's land scattered with rocks and a severed plane wing, where Ts can contest control of a connector leading to the site, as well as the body of the crashed plane at the back. The close-range option routes Ts through a house, giving them the choice to emerge from the bottom floor or take high angles from an upstairs balcony. For added strategic depth, the elevated connector accessible via the long route can also be reached with a buddy boost, allowing Ts to bypass the open engagement entirely. This gives the Ts a wide variety of approach options, so to balance it out, two of these pathways require them to drop down, creating a sound cue that reveals their position. CTs also have several strong positions to hold and defend the site. Working on Debris was a hugely valuable experience, as it helped me get more comfortable collaborating across teams. I had weekly check-ins with the project lead/enviornment artist, Cooper Furtak, and technical artist, Angel Cuzacu, to provide gameplay-focused art feedback and to ensure the layout remained intact while still giving them room to creatively shape the environment. Often, this meant finding a middle ground that preserved gameplay integrity without limiting visual ambition. The team is super excited about this one, and we’re pushing hard to create a product that delivers both a visually striking setting and a broad range of gameplay opportunities."

        "designprocess": "I was the project lead for this map, creating the idea for the theme, making the layout, and forming a team of artists that includes Maxime Poutiline, Pablo Fernandez, and Marius Arcay. Liberty is one of the most challenging yet rewarding projects I've had the pleasure of working on. I was responsible for designing the layout, creating art assets, and decorating the environment. My goal was to emphasize a rather underutilized mechanic in Counter-Strike: bullet-penetrable surfaces. Taking out an opponent by shooting through a wall like an action hero is one of the most satisfying moments in the game, which is why I made it a central feature. The main focal point of the map is a gazebo-like structure covered in tarps that players can shoot through and peek over. The Source 2 engine's lighting system supports dynamic shadow casting, which I leveraged in this area. CTs can hold strong positions near the tarp, but at the cost of having their shadows projected onto it—giving Ts just enough information to go for those stylish wallbang kills. This setup creates dynamic, high-reward gameplay and encourages players to think creatively and use the environment to their advantage. Throughout development, I learned countless valuable lessons about building unique, competitive gameplay spaces. I even visited Liberty Island in real life to take reference photos and ensure the map looks as photorealistic as possible during the ongoing art pass."

        "designprocess": "At the time of making Abstract, I didn't have a ton of environment art experience or asset creation experience, so I had to rely heavily on the vanilla assets that come with the Source 2 Engine. However, I still wanted to make a unique location with fun gameplay that didn't feel like an already-done theme in CS2. Eventually, I landed on doing some sort of artsy brutalist place because it would allow me to make unconventional geometry while still having it make sense in the space — not to mention most of the map would be made of concrete, which most people wouldn't associate with already existing maps. To further divert it from other maps, I decided to place the mansion in a Costa Rican rainforest filled to the brim with foliage and scenic waterfalls. I achieved this rainforest look by taking already existing foliage, rock, and water assets provided by the Source 2 Engine and swapping out the textures of the props to give them a brand new appearance. Gameplay on the map really tries to embody the feeling of being abstract, as the name suggests. The Ts must infiltrate the mansion and plant the bomb in the central room or the balcony it connects to. They have access to a fast 'main' doorway to the bombsite, a snaking ledge that leads to a long bathing pool, and a staircase going to an upstairs kitchen. The main door is self-explanatory — it's your fast option to site with no extra strings. Taking control of the long bath rewards Ts with a side entrance to site and a jump-up area to the CT spawn/back of site. But be careful when approaching this angle, as getting pushed back to the snaking platform is not somewhere you want to be due to the small size of the platform and the lack of guardrails preventing you from falling off the map to your demise. Then there's the upstairs lane, which routes Ts into a kitchen that sits directly above the bathing pool. Taking control of the kitchen gives you access to the CT spawn and back of site, but there is also a ledge looking down into the bathing area from here, meaning you can shoot down at players in the pool, and you can also drop off the ledge and land in the pool to break your fall and switch lanes in a quick one-way motion. Lastly, there's the actual bombsite area itself, which is a big open gallery room with a central hero prop of a stone pillar-like statue, with two outdoor balcony areas attached to it. One balcony is very close to the CT spawn and has a flowing water fountain in the middle of it that players can defend the site from. The other balcony wraps around the outer wall of the mansion, with the bombsite stretching from the middle of the gallery onto the end of the balcony. This creates an interesting bombsite dynamic where, after you plant the bomb, you can pick if you want to leave the site and defend the bomb from one of the appendages, or commit to hunkering down on the balcony part of the site where you don't have anywhere to escape to, but you can comfortably defend the only entrance the CTs can push you from. I am very proud of Abstract because it is my first fully finished project that I published on Steam. I created a very different type of layout that playtesters enjoyed for its strategic gameplay, and I was able to make a map with a very avant-garde setting, all while working within the limitations of using a limited asset library as the main means of detailing."

        "designprocess": "Whack-A-Mole was a solo project I made for a 24-hour mapping jam. The goal for me was to create a new game mode for Counter-Strike 2 that was simple, fun, and easy to pick up and play. I started brainstorming ways to flip the game's traditional combat on its head, and eventually landed on the idea: what if every player had a small safety bunker, but leaving it would throw them into a warzone? Thus, the concept for Whack A Mole was born. To summarize how it plays: it's essentially a free-for-all where players are 'shrunken down' to mole size, and you have to kill the other moles. At the start of each round, you are randomly spawned into a hole in the ground, equipped with a scout rifle, a flashbang, and a frag grenade. You can't leave your hole, but you can move around inside it and crouch to hide. You're almost completely safe while crouched, but in order to win, you need to pop your head out, locate enemies (who can spawn anywhere around you), and try to snipe or blow them up. Players aren't given any armor at the start of the round, making frag grenades especially deadly. However, landing a grenade into another player's hole is extremely difficult—especially if you're crouched and can't even see the target when you throw it. Successfully landing a grenade can either instantly kill an opponent or severely weaken them, allowing body shots or limb shots to finish them off—where normally only headshots would be one-hit-kills. Flashbangs add another layer of strategy by allowing players to blind other moles, often forcing them to crouch back into their holes. This gives you the upper hand, letting you hold an angle and wait for them to recover and pop back up. Altogether, this creates a chaotic, fast-paced gameplay loop that tests players' reaction time, aim, and decision-making under pressure."

While my primary focus centered on enemy design and the development of the spellcasting system, I also contributed to the broader gameplay framework, including early progression pacing and player resource systems. I designed a range of enemy archetypes to challenge players across different combat scenarios and built a flexible spell tree that allowed for diverse playstyles and spell combinations. As development progressed, I collaborated with the programming team to refine and rebalance the core combat mechanics, which initially felt overly punishing. Together, we fine-tuned damage models, hit feedback, and player responsiveness to bring the gameplay experience closer to our intended design goals. In the final stretch of development, I shifted into level design, utilizing the finalized environment tileset to create a modular set of dungeon rooms for procedural generation. Although there are still areas I would refine given more development time, I’m proud of my contributions to The Queen’s Burrow, especially in shaping the game’s combat experience and supporting systems under a tight production timeline."
