The map is very compact to ensure rounds are fast paced and players must take cover between wood palettes and inflatable bags to win control of this makeshift battlefield. As an avid paintballer, creating a map with the theme of a sport I love was inevitable and I am super proud that I was finally able to help bring Splat to life."

I was responsible for designing the layout, creating art assets, and decorating the environment. My goal was to emphasize a rather underutilized mechanic in Counter-Strike: bullet-penetrable surfaces. Taking out an opponent by shooting through a wall like an action hero is one of the most satisfying moments in the game, which is why I made it a central feature. The main focal point of the map is a gazebo-like structure covered in tarps that players can shoot through and peek over. The Source 2 engine’s lighting system supports dynamic shadow casting, which I leveraged in this area. CTs can hold strong positions near the tarp, but at the cost of having their shadows projected onto it—giving Ts just enough information to go for those stylish wallbang kills. This setup creates dynamic, high-reward gameplay and encourages players to think creatively and use the environment to their advantage. Throughout development, I learned countless valuable lessons about building unique, competitive gameplay spaces. I even visited Liberty Island in real life to take reference photos and ensure the map looked as photorealistic as possible during the art pass."

        "designprocess": "My approach to Debris was quite different from previous projects, as it was the first map where I wasn’t the project lead and had to work within preset guidelines. I was responsible for designing the layout and blocking it out in-engine for playtesting and refinement, preparing it for the art team. Gameplay begins with the Ts moving down a large forking path—one leading to long-range engagements, the other to close-quarters combat. The 'long' route pushes players into an open no man’s land scattered with rocks and a severed plane wing, where Ts can contest control of a connector leading to the site, as well as the body of the crashed plane at the back. The close-range option routes Ts through a house, giving them the choice to emerge from the bottom floor or take high angles from an upstairs balcony. For added strategic depth, the elevated connector accessible via the 'long' route can also be reached with a buddy boost, allowing Ts to bypass the open engagement entirely. This gives the Ts a large variety of approach options, so to balance it out, two of these pathways require them to drop down, creating a sound cue that reveals their position. CTs also have several strong spots to hold and defend the site. Working on Debris was a super valuable experience, as it helped me get comfortable communicating with other teams. I would have weekly check ins with the art team to give them art feedback and to make sure the gameplay was staying in tact while also allowing for them to get creative with the environment decoration in ways I initially didn't account for, finding middle ground that didn’t compromise either gameplay or art. The team was always super excited about this one, and we ended up with a final product that showcases both a beautiful setting and a wide range of gameplay opportunities."

        "designprocess": "At the time of making Abstract, I didn't have a ton of environment art experience or asset creation experience, so I had to rely heavily on the vanilla assets that come with the Source 2 Engine. However, I still wanted to make a unique location with fun gameplay that didn't feel like an already-done theme in CS2. Eventually, I landed on doing some sort of artsy brutalist place because it would allow me to make unconventional geometry while still having it make sense in the space — not to mention most of the map would be made of concrete, which most people wouldn't associate with already existing maps. To further divert it from other maps, I decided to place the mansion in a Costa Rican rainforest filled to the brim with foliage and scenic waterfalls. I achieved this rainforest look by taking already existing foliage, rock, and water assets provided by the Source 2 Engine and swapping out the textures of the props to give them a brand new appearance. Gameplay on the map really tries to embody the feeling of being abstract, as the name suggests. The Ts must infiltrate the mansion and plant the bomb in the central room or the balcony it connects to. They have access to a fast 'main' doorway to the bombsite, a snaking ledge that leads to a long bathing pool, and a staircase going to an upstairs kitchen. The main door is self-explanatory — it's your fast option to site with no extra strings. Taking control of the long bath rewards Ts with a side entrance to site and a jump-up area to the CT spawn/back of site. But be careful when approaching this angle, as getting pushed back to the snaking platform is not somewhere you want to be due to the small size of the platform and the lack of guardrails preventing you from falling off the map to your demise. Then there's the upstairs lane, which routes Ts into a kitchen that sits directly above the bathing pool. Taking control of the kitchen gives you access to the CT spawn and back of site, but there is also a ledge looking down into the bathing area from here, meaning you can shoot down at players in the pool, and you can also drop off the ledge and land in the pool to break your fall and switch lanes in a quick one-way motion. Lastly, there's the actual bombsite area itself, which is a big open gallery room with a central hero prop of a stone pillar-like statue, with two outdoor balcony areas attached to it. One balcony is very close to the CT spawn and has a flowing water fountain in the middle of it that players can defend the site from. The other balcony wraps around the outer wall of the mansion, with the bombsite stretching from the middle of the gallery onto the end of the balcony. This creates an interesting bombsite dynamic where, after you plant the bomb, you can pick if you want to leave the site and defend the bomb from one of the appendages, or commit to hunkering down on the balcony part of the site where you don't have anywhere to escape to, but you can comfortably defend the only entrance the CTs can push you from. I am very proud of Abstract because it is my first fully finished project that I published on Steam. I created a very different type of layout that playtesters enjoyed for its strategic gameplay, and I was able to make a map with a very avant-garde setting, all while working within the limitations of using a limited asset library as the main means of detailing."

        "designprocess": "The goal for me was to create a new game mode for Counter-Strike 2 that was simple, fun, and easy to pick up and play. I started brainstorming ways to flip the game's traditional combat on its head, and eventually landed on the idea: what if every player had a small safety bunker, but leaving it would throw them into a warzone? Thus, the concept for Whack A Mole was born. To summarize how it plays: it's essentially a free-for-all where players are 'shrunken down' to mole size, and you have to kill the other moles. At the start of each round, you are randomly spawned into a hole in the ground, equipped with a scout rifle, a flashbang, and a frag grenade. You can't leave your hole, but you can move around inside it and crouch to hide. You're almost completely safe while crouched, but in order to win, you need to pop your head out, locate enemies (who can spawn anywhere around you), and try to snipe or blow them up. Players aren't given any armor at the start of the round, making frag grenades especially deadly. However, landing a grenade into another player’s hole is extremely difficult—especially if you're crouched and can't even see the target when you throw it. Successfully landing a grenade can either instantly kill an opponent or severely weaken them, allowing body shots or limb shots to finish them off—where normally only headshots would be one-hit-kills. Flashbangs add another layer of strategy by allowing players to blind other moles, often forcing them to crouch back into their holes. This gives you the upper hand, letting you hold an angle and wait for them to recover and pop back up. Altogether, this creates a chaotic, fast-paced gameplay loop that tests players’ reaction time, aim, and decision-making under pressure."

My goal was to create a map where hazard zones are a central gameplay element—something that’s a first for Counter-Strike, at least when compared to all officially released maps to date. And what better location to make a map with hazard zones then a radioactive waste plant with glowing green sludge? At the core of the design is a wall in T main that’s slightly taller than the player. Most engagements revolve around this wall. On both sides, Ts and CTs each have access to upper and lower pathways. The wall is tall enough to block sightlines for players on the lower level, but short enough for players on the upper level to shoot each other over—creating a compelling crossfire dynamic between the two elevations. There’s also a fourth flanking route on the opposite side of the map, giving Ts strong cover and powerful post-plant positioning. However, using it comes at the cost of making noise and/or taking damage while crossing through toxic sludge. All of these ideas came together into a layout that was very well received immediately after its creation and introduces some exciting new angles and gameplay elements never before seen in a Counter-Strike map. I am currently working on the art pass for this map in my free time."
