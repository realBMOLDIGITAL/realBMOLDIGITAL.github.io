          Splat is a close-quarters Wingman map set in a colorful paintball
          arena nestled in the rural farmlands of Kentucky. As an avid
          paintballer myself, I wanted to shape the gameplay around having tight
          routes and dynamic engagements that really embody the adrenaline
          pumping feeling you get while playing paintball on a hot summer day.  

          \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  

          I was the project lead and level designer for Splat. I pitched the
          theme, laid out the initial design, and saw the project through from
          early sketch to final art pass. Working with environment artist Cooper
          Furtak, we were able to bring Splat to life as a believable paintball
          field packed with personality and energy.  

          \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  

          Designed specifically for Wingman, Splat features a compact layout
          that forces early engagements but layers in strategic complexity
          through multiple attack routes and dynamic defensive choices. The
          central bombsite is surrounded by inflatable bunkers, wooden pallets,
          and key landmarks like a parked bus and a wooden “castle” that acts as
          a sniper perch. Ts can directly attack the site from 2 main options,
          which include a risky push through or around the bus or a flank via
          the elevated blue building, while CTs must make real-time decisions on
          how to allocate their defense between site and a crucial off-site
          control area that I refer to as the “power zone.” This area offers an
          alternate route to site and forces both teams to constantly reassess
          their positioning, encouraging mind games and adaptive strategies. The
          map's tight geometry also levels the playing field on eco rounds,
          giving players with shotguns or smart angles a real chance to shine
          against stronger buys.  

          \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  

          Visually, I wanted the map to reflect the lively, scrappy nature of
          paintball arenas I’ve played in, which gave us the creative freedom to
          include classic paintball features like inflatable bunkers, plywood
          walls, and referee towers, all soaked in bright splashes of color. I
          worked closely with Cooper to ensure the art direction aligned with
          the gameplay: every visual element serves a purpose, from the way
          paint splatters subtly guide the eye to areas of engagement, to the
          use of distinct landmark structures for callouts and orientation. We
          developed a mood board to stay aligned on tone and aesthetics,
          ensuring the final space felt authentic.  

          \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  

          My overall goal with Splat was to create something punchy, readable,
          and undeniably fun. Through focused playtesting with both casual
          players and fellow game designers, I was able to tune the layout until
          sessions became so engaging that testers wanted to keep playing even
          after the tests had ended. That was the moment I knew Splat was ready,
          and I’m incredibly proud of how it turned out.
