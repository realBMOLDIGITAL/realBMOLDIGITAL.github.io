        text: Abstract was my first-ever map for Counter-Strike 2 and holds a special
          place in my heart. It's a Wingman map set in a brutalist mansion in
          Costa Rica, built around verticality and a bombsite that wraps from an
          indoor section onto an outdoor balcony. I was responsible for the
          level design and the environment art.

        text: At the time of making Abstract, I didn't have a ton of environment art
          experience or asset creation experience, so I had to rely heavily on
          the vanilla assets that come with the Source 2 Engine. However, I
          still wanted to make a unique location with fun gameplay that didn't
          feel like an already-done theme in CS2. Eventually, I landed on doing
          some sort of artsy brutalist place because it would allow me to make
          unconventional geometry while still having it make sense in the space
          - not to mention most of the map would be made of concrete, which most
          people wouldn't associate with already existing maps. To further
          divert it from other maps, I decided to place the mansion in a Costa
          Rican rainforest filled to the brim with foliage and scenic
          waterfalls. I achieved the rainforest look by taking already existing
          foliage, rock, and water assets provided by the Source 2 Engine and
          swapping out the textures of the props to give them a brand-new
          appearance.

        text: Gameplay on the map really tries to embody the feeling of being abstract,
          as the name suggests. The Ts must infiltrate the mansion and plant the
          bomb in the central room or the balcony it connects to. They have
          access to a fast 'main' doorway to the bombsite, a snaking ledge that
          leads to a long bathing pool, and a staircase going to an upstairs
          kitchen.

        text: The main door is self-explanatory - it's your fast option to site with no
          extra strings. Taking control of the long bath rewards Ts with a side
          entrance to site and a jump-up area to the CT spawn/back of site. But
          be careful when approaching this angle, as getting pushed back to the
          snaking platform is not somewhere you want to be due to the small size
          of the platform and the lack of guardrails preventing you from falling
          off the map to your demise. Then there's the upstairs lane, which
          routes Ts into a kitchen that sits directly above the bathing pool.
          Taking control of the kitchen gives you access to the CT spawn and
          back of site, but there is also a ledge looking down into the bathing
          area from here, meaning you can shoot down at players in the pool, and
          you can also drop off the ledge and land in the pool to break your
          fall and switch lanes in a quick one-way motion. Lastly, there's the
          actual bombsite area itself, which is a big open gallery room with a
          central hero prop of a stone pillar-like statue, with two outdoor
          balcony areas attached to it. One balcony is very close to the CT
          spawn and has a flowing water fountain in the middle of it that
          players can defend the site from. The other balcony wraps around the
          outer wall of the mansion, with the bombsite stretching from the
          middle of the gallery onto the end of the balcony. This creates an
          interesting bombsite dynamic where, after you plant the bomb, you can
          pick if you want to leave the site and defend the bomb from one of the
          appendages, or commit to hunkering down on the balcony part of the
          site where you don't have anywhere to escape to, but you can
          comfortably defend the only entrance the CTs can push you from.

        text: I am very proud of Abstract because it is my first fully finished project
          that I published on Steam. I created a very different type of layout
          that playtesters enjoyed for its strategic gameplay, and I was able to
          make a map with a very avant-garde setting, all while working within
          the limitations of using a limited asset library as the main means of
          detailing.
