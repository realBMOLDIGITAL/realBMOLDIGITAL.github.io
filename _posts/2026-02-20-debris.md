        text: Debris is a Wingman map centered around a military plane that has
          crash-landed in Madagascar. After the local villagers evacuated,
          smugglers moved in, turning the crash site and its valuable cargo into
          a black-market hub.

        image_caption: The crash site is littered with busted up plane pieces and weapon
          crates, along with a graffitied water tower and shanty stores to sell
          the "pop-up black market" look.

        text: "Debris is built around two distinct lanes: a close-quarters path that
          drives fast, aggressive engagements, and a medium-to-long range route
          that emphasizes slower paced gameplay and gaining powerful map
          control. Both are packed with flanking options and cover variety,
          forcing players into making constant micro-decisions."

        text: My approach to Debris was quite different from previous projects, as it
          was the first map I worked on where I wasn't the project lead and had
          to operate within preset guidelines. I was responsible for designing
          the layout, blocking it out in-engine for playtesting and refinement,
          and preparing it for the artists.

        text: Working on Debris was a hugely valuable experience, as it helped me get
          more comfortable collaborating across teams. I had weekly check-ins
          with the project lead/environment artist, Cooper Furtak, to provide
          gameplay-focused art feedback and to ensure the layout remained intact
          while still giving them room to creatively shape the environment.
          Often, this meant finding a middle ground that preserved gameplay
          integrity without limiting visual ambition. Cooper and I are super
          excited about how this turned out, we pushed super hard to create a
          product that delivers both a visually striking setting and a broad
          range of gameplay opportunities.
