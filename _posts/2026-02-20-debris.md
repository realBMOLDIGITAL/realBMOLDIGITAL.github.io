        text: Debris is a Wingman map centered around a military plane that has
          crash-landed in Madagascar. After the local villagers evacuated,
          smugglers moved in, turning the crash site and its valuable cargo into
          a black-market hub.

        text: "Debris is built around two distinct lanes: a close-quarters path that
          drives fast, aggressive engagements, and a medium-to-long range route
          that emphasizes slower paced gameplay and gaining powerful map
          control. Both are packed with flanking options and cover variety,
          forcing players into making constant micro-decisions."

        text: My approach to Debris was quite different from previous projects, as it
          was the first map I worked on where I wasn't the project lead and had
          to operate within preset guidelines. I was responsible for designing
          the layout, blocking it out in-engine for playtesting and refinement,
          and preparing it for the artists.
