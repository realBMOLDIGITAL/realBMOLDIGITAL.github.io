          CONTRIBUTIONS AS A DESIGNER  

          As the lead gameplay designer on the project, I was responsible for
          the following tasks:


          *   Designed each section of the layout from initial concept to ship.
              
          *   Pitched and designed all functions of the Guard Dog mechanic.
              
          *   Blocked out the level in 3D space to provide for the art team.
              
          *   Coordinated playtests with QA and made level revisions based on
          feedback.
              
          *   Collaborated with art to maintain clear player visibility and
          spatial legibility throughout art pass.
              
          *   Implemented and tuned world audio to add life to the space without
          it getting distracting.
              
          *   Worked with programming to help implement and tune the dog
          scripting.
              
          *   Clipped the map to smooth out angles and prevent players from
          getting out of bounds.

          GUARD DOG SYSTEM  

          A map-integrated AI entity that acts as an organic sensor. The Guard
          Dog idly observes the map from behind a fence and reacts to anything
          in its line of sight, converting player behavior and environmental
          interaction into audible information for both teams. The system
          redefines how players use sound, utility, and even set dressing, to
          gain a tactical advantage. Here's what I did to bring it to life:


          *   Designed the Guard Dog as a reactive alarm system that barks at
          players, dropped weapons, and props with ragdoll physics within its
          line of sight.
              
          *   Defined fear responses to loud noises such as gunfire and utility
          explosions, causing the dog to flee and hide for the remainder of the
          round.
              
          *   Implemented smoke grenade interaction to temporarily block the
          dog’s vision and disable its bark without removing it from play.
              
          *   Collaborated with the art team to make the dog immediately
          readable through warning signage and a spotlight that projects his
          animated shadow and clearly defines his line of sight.
              

          This frames the dog not as a gimmick, but as a deeply dynamic feature
          that players can manipulate to gain information, create false
          information, or deny information. The guard dog creates a whole new
          scenario in Counter-Strike where being mindful of ragdoll props, where
          you create loud noise, and what sightlines you cross, creates a new
          gameplay loop for players to learn and master.

          CLUBHOUSE LAYOUT  

          A four-lane layout built to make information a tangible resource in
          2v2 play. Defenders are tasked with holding multiple threat vectors,
          two of which require attackers to audibly reveal themselves on entry.
          Each area offers a distinct gameplay dynamic different from the other
          areas.


          *   Pub approach that functions as a no-man’s-land of long range
          off-angles and partial cover.
              
          *   Scrapyard anchored by the Guard Dog with medium range battles.
              
          *   Arcade CQB interior that funnels directly into the site and
          connects to the pub.
              
          *   Tight elevated vent route that demands either a boost or a skill
          jump and announces entry onto site with a loud drop.
              
          *   Motorcycle garage that contains a rather open bombsite, with a few
          bikes and toolboxes to plant behind. Encourages making your own
          'cover' with smokes.
              
          *   Outdoor deck that connects the back of site to the pub and is
          where defenders spawn.
              
          *   Gas station where attackers spawn in and rotate between the 4
          lanes through.
